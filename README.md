We used HTML and CSS for styling the website and some hover effects to the buttons on the page. JavaScript DOM and LocalStorage.

CSS: It is used to add styling to the website. We used Advance CSS for Animation, Popup Modal window for login/Sign up, Payment, and for adding Address.

JavaScript: It is used to add logical functionalities to the webpages like the onClick function, DOM, and dynamic aspects of the webpage. We used localStorage to store products and Login Details. We have added all the functionalities.
## Some Snapshots of Website:
Landing Page: On Landing Page,there was a Dropdown Function and Animation in the top heading and the carousal effect of images. We achieved all functionalities. This Website is responsive you can use this in small devices also 👇
